Working in Professor Bajcsy's Nano-Photonics and Quantum Optics Laboratory on the manufacturing of fiber based Fabry Perot cavities. 

## Assemblies Overview
This gives a brief explanation of each of the assemblies tested.  
### PolarizationMethod
This assembly was used to test the butt-coupling method of UV resin transfer. There were many iterations of this design, this assembly currently represents the final iteration, which was manufactured at the end of the work term.

### Camera Setup
This two camera setup was used to see the fiber alignment for the butt-coupling technique. It uses a rack and pinion design to vary the distance of the camera to the sample so that the focus can be easily found. There also exists a configuration with fixed distances, which has better structural integrity.

### RotatingCamera
This is a single USB camera mount with variable rotation. It can be used to view the reflection of the fiber in order to insure the fiber is perpendicular to the mirror. 

###ChipHolder
This simple assembly is used as a mounting feature for the fiber holder chip. It can be used to mount both the horizontal optical post as well as to sit stably on the translation stage.

## Parts Organization
Most parts were custom designed to be 3D printed, thus are stored in the CustomParts folder. Some of the later assemblies also are stored in this folder. The COTS folder stores the off the shelf items, most coming from [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/) or [Thor Labs](https://www.thorlabs.com/index.cfm)


## Other
Various photos of test performed can be found in the photos folder. In addition, the slides for presentations are in the GroupMeetings folder.
